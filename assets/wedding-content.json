      "q": "Are there any obligations besides the ceremony/reception?",
      "a": "No! We will be doing a very informal welcome reception, location TBD, on Wednesday 4/29, but nothing planned for Saturday or Sunday so you can stay and enjoy the weekend with us, or you can get back to real life if necessary."
